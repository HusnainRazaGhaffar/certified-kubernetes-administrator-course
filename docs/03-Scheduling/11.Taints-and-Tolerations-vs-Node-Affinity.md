# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/taints-and-tolerations-vs-node-affinity/)

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
- So to restrict certain pods to certain nodes, we need to apply taints and toleration as well as node affinity. This is because taints and toleration are the restrictions from the node point of view and node affinity are restrictions from the pods point of view
- Taints and Tolerations do not guarantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes; in this case, the red pods may end up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific parts.
